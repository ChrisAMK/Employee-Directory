This week's task was to create an Employee Directory that displayed a bunch of employees of a company, display their id, name, phone and date of birth. The application was built on React, React is handy in the way we can keep our application modulialized with components. Because of this we are able to combine programming with components to conditionally render components to create a quite interactive application. We had to learn about state and how it operates as a sort of memory inside a component, that way we can store variables and data to individual components.
